            Man's search for knowledge is an activity that has defined our time on earth as a species. The constant evolution of our thought processes spear-headed by philosophers in times past,academic researchers in the modern age has shaped our way of life and thinking a s much as anything else on earth
            A dominant species with the free reins to conquer always posed the threat of consuming themselves from the inside in search of perfection. Now with the arrival of the 5th industiral age and advancement in technology, we are faced with questions that we never prepared for. 
            Prominent among those is <em>"how much knowledge is too much knowledge?"</em>.

            After years of conquest and outright domination of our environment, earth, our home has decided to fight back. We have decimated our resouces, living and non-living alike to the point where they have now gathered forces to fight the very evil that plagues the planet. Humans.
            The need to profer a solution has never been more dire. Of which, conquering space is not among them. It feels like a nobel cause at fisr. The desire to go beyond the ends  of our galaxy, to answer the burning question of if we are all alone in this unending universe. But our record already speaks for itself.
            We are just going to conquer, dominate and exahaust every resource availabe to us in our new homes. Then after, we find a new planet to inhabit. Then rinse and repeat. This does not in any way bode well for us. The alternative to that is to pick up arms against mother earth and try to stand our ground in her consumate effort to run us out of town.
            We know how that ended for the dinosaurs and other species before us. That is a battle that unfortunately, we cannot win.
